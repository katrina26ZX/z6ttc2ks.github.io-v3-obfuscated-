Types of commercial cards include: Corporate Card, Purchase Card, and Business Card. Corporate card A Corporate card is usually issued to the employees of a corporation, where the corporation assumes all liability for the card’s usage. These tend to be to larger corporations.</p><p>CURRENCY CONVERSION -&gt; The process by which the transaction currency is converted into the currency of settlement or the currency of the issuer for the purpose of facilitating transaction authorization, clearing and settlement reporting. The acquirer determines the currency of the transaction; the currency of the issuer is the preferred currency used by the issuer, and most often, the currency in which the cardholder will be billed.</p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debitcard.asp">DEBIT CARD</a> -&gt; A plastic card used to initiate a debit transaction. In general, these transactions are used primarily to purchase goods and services and to obtain cash, for which the cardholder’s asset account is debited by the issuer</p><p>DECODE -&gt; A term used to describe the process of interpreting scanned or “read” information and presenting it in a usable fashion to the computer.</p><p>DENSITY -&gt; Defined in bits per inch (BPI), recording density is the number of information bits which are recorded on one inch of a magnetic strip.</p><p>DIRECT THERMAL -&gt; Direct thermal is a printing technology method in which the printer utilizes a paper that reacts chemically to heat. The label rolls are coated with a thermo-sensitive layer that darkens when exposed to intense heat. Direct thermal printers require no ink or ribbon and are typically used when a bar code label needs to endure for a year or less.</p><p>DIRECT-TO-CARD (DTC) PRINTING -&gt; The Direct-to-Card printing process prints digital images directly onto any plastic card with a smooth, clean, glossy PVC surface.</p><p>DISKETTE / FLOPPY DISK -&gt; A flexible disk which holds information that can be read by the computer.</p><p>DOS (Disk Operation System) -&gt; The standard operation system for all computers advertised as “IBM Compatible”.</p><p>DOT-MATRIX PRINTER -&gt; A printer that forms characters or images using a matrix of pins that strike an inked ribbon.</p><p>DOWNLOADING -&gt; The process of sending configuration parameters, operating software or related data from a central source to remote stations.</p><p>DPI (dots per inch) -&gt; Measurement of a printer’s resolution. Example: 600 dpi indicates that the printer can produce 600 dots of color in each inch of a card. NOTE: When judging color reproduction for a CardJet Card Printer, the inkjet resolution must be at 2400 dpi or better to achieve the color equivalent of a 300 dpi dye-sub printer.</p><p>DUAL HOPPERS -&gt; Select FARGO Card Printer/Encoders provide a dual-stack, 200 card capacity Card inp&lt;-b&gt;ut Hopper. This unique dual hopper allows you to load up to 200 of the same type of card for maximum card production or allows you to load a different stack of cards into each hopper for added versatility and efficiency. Loading two different stacks of cards is often beneficial if, for example, you are using two types of preprinted card backgrounds (i.e. gold cards versus silver cards) in order to more easily distinguish between two types of members, employees, students, etc.</p><p>DUAL TRACK -&gt; A type of credit cared reader that is capable of reading both Track 1 and 2 on a credit card.</p><p>DYE-SUBLIMATION -&gt; Dye-sublimation is the print process FARGO Card Printer/Encoders use to print smooth, continuous-tone, photo-quality images. This process uses a dye-based ribbon roll that is divided into a series of color panels. The color panels are grouped in a repeating series of three separate colors along the length of the ribbon: Yellow, Magenta, and Cyan (YMC). As the ribbon and card pass simultaneously beneath the Printhead, hundreds of thermal elements heat the dyes on the ribbon. Once the dyes are heated, they vaporize and diffuse into the surface of the card. Varying the heat intensity of each thermal element within the Printhead makes it possible for each transferred dot of color to vary saturation. This blends one color into the next. The result is continuous-tone, photo-realistic color images.</p><p>Debit Card -&gt; Card, which resembles the credit card by the method of using, but making possible to realize direct buyer account debiting at the moment of the purchase of goods or service.</p><p>Delivery Versus Payment (DVP) -&gt; the system of calculations in the operations with the valuable papers, which ensures the mechanism, which guarantees that the delivery will occur only in the case of payment and at the moment of payment.</p><p>Direcht debit -&gt; payment levy method, mainly, with the repetitive nature (lease pay, insurance reward, etc.) with which the debitor authorizes his financial establishment to debit his current account when obtaining of calculation on payment from the indicated creditor.</p><p>Electronic Fund Transfer (EFT) -&gt; the remittance of means, initiated from the terminal, telephone or magnetic carrier (tape or diskette), by transfer of instructions or authorities to financial establishment, that concern to the debiting or crediting of the account (see Electronic Fund Transfer/Point of Sale -&gt; EFT/POS).</p><p>Electronic Fund Transfer/Point of Sale -&gt; EFT/POS -&gt; debiting from the electronic terminal, for the means transfer purpose from the account of a buyer into the payment on the obligations, which arose in the course of transaction at the point of sale.</p><p>E-CARD DOCKING STATION -&gt; FARGO provides an optional e-card docking station on select models that can be ordered with encoders for one, two or three different types of e-cards.
