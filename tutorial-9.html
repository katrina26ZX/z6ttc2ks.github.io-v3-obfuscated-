				<h3>Bank Response Codes</h3>
				<p>Common types of responses from the banks include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Transaction approved: Your customer’s transaction was processed successfully.</li>
					<li>Insufficient funds: The customer’s bank noted that there was not enough money available on the card.</li>
					<li>Card expired: The card used is expired. Has the card been replaced?</li>
					<li>Refer to issuer: This can mean many different things, ultimately you will need to tell your customer to contact their card issuing bank. Do they have another card they can use?</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Please find below a more complete list of the Response Codes you may receive from your merchant bank, plus a description on what those responses mean.</p>
				
				
				
				
				
				
				<p>Important notes:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>The text “CUST CONTACT THEIR BANK”/”CONTACT BANK” means that you need to advise your customer to contact their bank to enquire if there is a problem with their card. If repeated attempts to collect money from this customer using a credit card fail, you should request an alternate credit card for payment.</li>
					<li>The actual response text displayed with a response code may vary between banks, and is subject to change at any time. The response text may also vary between test and live systems.</li>
					<li>The majority of response codes in the range 00-99 are returned by the card holder’s bank- eWAY and your merchant bank do not have any control over them.</li>
				</ol>
