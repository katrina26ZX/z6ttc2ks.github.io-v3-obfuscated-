				<h3>Dumps cash out – What is a dump</h3>
				<p>This days carding become well known world wide. No matter in which side of it you are,like victim or performer,if you want to understand the carding you came in the right place. Someone used your card and you don’t know how this was possible? Keep reading</p>
				<p>Dumps are used by carders to cloning the real cards and used the clone as the genuine. So, those clones are duplication of the real cards and can be used like the real card. How is this possible?</p>
				<p>The answer is dump!</p>
				<p>So what is a dump,you may ask.And here is the answer. Dumps are bank data connected to a bank account and encoded in the magnetic strip of the bank cards.So each card is attached to a bank account.The card is a terminal which allows the account owner to access the his account fund without necessity to walk in bank.Cards can be used to ATM or POS ,this are also bank terminals. So if someone get access to the information stored in the magnetic strip of your card then he has full access to your account and the money saved in it.</p>
				<p>At this moment you probably think how can someone steal your card dump but I can tell you that this as not difficult to do.Dumps are obtain by skimming,sniffing or hacking. So each and every time you pay with the card you assume the risk that your card data was stolen.</p>
				<p>Bank dumps have usual 3 tracks ,but if any of the 3 tracks is correct and in the account are sufficient funds then the card is good to be used and the requested transaction should be approved.</p>
				<p>Track 1 is the only track of the card which contain the holder name. Carder use to change the name from the track to match with the fake ID’s they have or with the name embossed on the plastic.This track is written with code known as odd parity or DEC SIXBIT. Track 1 format is</p>
				<p>B5466160081187237^SHORT/JAMES D ^140910100000023001000000415000000</p>
				<p>START SENTINEL=is 1 character,usual %</p>
				<p>FORMAT CODE= a single character,financial cards format code is B</p>
				<p>PRIMARY ACCOUNT NUMBER (PAN) =usual is the card number,but not always</p>
				<p>FIELD SEPARATOR =financial cards use a single symbol for it which is ^</p>
				<p>NAME OF CARD HOLDER=contain 2 until 26 characters</p>
				<p>FIELD SEPARATOR= symbol for it  is ^</p>
				<p>EXPIRE DATE =in format YYMM (year,month)</p>
				<p>SERVICE CODE=three characters</p>
				<p>DISCRETIONARY DATA=which may contain PIN VERIFICATION KEY  (it is not the ATM PIN),card verification value ,CVV</p>
				<p>END SENTINEL=is 1 character,usual ?</p>
				<p>Track 2 it is the track developed by the banking  industry and it is most important track of a dump. Almost all dumps will work if this track 2 is correct. It is written with a 5 bit-scheme,4 data bits and 1 parity.This track data format is</p>
				<p>START SENTINEL=is usual 1 character ;</p>
				<p>PRIMARY ACCOUNT NUMBER (PAN)=usual the card number</p>
				<p>SEPARATOR=usual symbol = is used</p>
				<p>EXPIRE DATE=in YYMM format</p>
				<p>SERVICE CODE=a three digits code</p>
				<p>DISCRETIONARY DATA=which may contain PIN VERIFICATION KEY  (it is not the ATM PIN),card verification value ,CVV</p>
				<p>END SENTINEL= usual the symbol ?</p>
				<p>Track 3 is virtually unused by the major world wide networks.It was developed by Thrift Saving Industry.Point Of Sales not read  this track.</p>
				<p>SERVICE CODE</p>
				<p>The card service code is a 3 digits code present in both track 1 and track 2.Each of the 3 digits o f the code has a meaning and read it together the service code let us know where and how the card can be used</p>
				<p>If the first digit is</p>
				
				
				
				<p>1-card is for international use</p>
				<p>2-card is for international use but has chip</p>
				<p>5-card is for national use</p>
				<p>6-card is for national use but has chip</p>
				<p>7-card is not good for interchange except for bilateral agreements</p>
				<p>9-test card</p>
				<p>If the second digit is</p>
				<p>0-card is normal,without restriction</p>
				<p>2-issuer must be contacted via online means</p>
				<p>4-issuer must be contacted via online means except under bilateral agreements</p>
				<p>If the last digit is</p>
				<p>0-no restriction but PIN is required</p>
				<p>1-no restrictions</p>
				<p>2-card can be used for goods and services payment but not for cash</p>
				<p>3-ATM use only,PIN is required</p>
				<p>4-cash only</p>
				<p>5-card can be used for goods and services payment but not for cash  but PIN is required</p>
				<p>6-no restrictions,PIN should be used where is feasible</p>
				<p>7-card can be used for goods and services payment but not for cash  but PIN should be used where is feasible</p>
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
				
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
		
				<p>So,your card magnetic strip or/and chip contain all the information to access and operate your bank account.If someone copied your card magnetic strip ,that person can use an machine called msr ,magnetic strip reader-writer and write the data from your card in an other card and use the clone as the genuine card.</p>
				<p>If you think that is hard to copy the magnetic strip to a card you must know that a simple swipe to a mini msr or the swipe of card in a compromised POS is all the cards need to get the data from your card and so the access to you account.So you should always pay attention when you make a payment with the card.More about this subject in future posts.</p>
				<p>Dumps cash – card cloning</p>
				<p>Hi guys I hope you all doing great! If you read the previous posts about dumps and skimming then you already know what dumps are and how can someone access your bank account money using a clone of your card.Today i will explain how a dump become a ready to swipe card. To encode a dump in a magnetic card strip is very simple and the necessary tools are very easy to find and buy from internet.</p>
				<p>Computer</p>
				<p>The common laptop or home PC ,everyone know what it is and how to use it.</p>
				<p>MSR– or so called magnetic strip reader-writer is a device used to read the data from the magnetic strip of a card .It is also used to encode (write) data on cards. Carders use the msr to write the dumps in the cards to obtain clones of the real cards.</p>
				<p>Pre Printed magnetic strip cards– are cards which look like the bank issued cards. The good quality cards even have the UV light security and the logo and hologram of the issuer. Those carders who hit high, like apple stores, gold shops, etc need this kind of cards which they have to emboss with the card number,expire date and holder name.The clone will look like the genuine card and the fraud will be very difficult to detect. Some carder print by them self the plastics but pre printed plastic also can be buy. The price of a pre printed plastic with UV light bypass, logo and hologram start from $10 and can reach $30. I’ll write a new post about pvc card printers, UV ribbons and card templates.</p>
				<p>Embosser – It is a machine used to emboss the card details (card number,expire date and holder name) to the pre- printed card. In market you can find manual or automatic embosser, price start from $250 until $3000, according with the embossing speed and quality.</p>
				<p>The software of the MSR must be installed in the computer and the machine  must be connected to the computer by a data transfer wire and the MSR is ready to encode the dumps in the cards.</p>
				<p>So with a pre printed card and embosser and an MSR the clone of the card is ready to use. Pre printed cards are embossed with the dump detail then using the MSR the magnetic strip of card encode the dump. And here you have the card ready to swipe.</p>
