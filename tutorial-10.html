				<h3>Drop Methods for Carders</h3>
				<p>Our customers constantly share with us information about how they acquire one or another product in online stores. Throughout our work, we have compiled a list of drop methods. These methods practically don’t appear in the articles and it is strange, they just have to help new carders</p>
                <p>Here the goal is to have a minimum/no contact at all with anyone involved in the operation whether it’s the postman or any other person that provides help and access to the carded items. Drops can be found by searching for empty houses around in an area,whether it’s the by car/walk or online. It will be an empty house and if you live in the usa and a parcel requires no signature,you will just be able to walk in later and pick it off the porch. In many other parts of the world,even if a parcel requires no signature,the postman will knock on the door to deliver and if nobody is there,he will drop a note, and you will have to pick it up at the post office or other options depending where you live. The specific thing about this guide is that it will allow you to card a very lot of item to one location for a period of time,even if it does require to sign for the parcel,because you won’t have to.</p>
