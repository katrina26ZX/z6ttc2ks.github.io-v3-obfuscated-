									<li>It does not work to buy bitcoins, it’s a giftcard without an associated name, it’s not accepted by any Exchange.</li>
									<li>In our experience it only works to buy items or pay for services. (Amazon, Nike, Adidas, eBay, Apple, Uber, etc)</li>
									<li>It can be spent in full, there are no spending limits.</li>
									<li>It’s totally safe to use. Zero risks.</li>
									<li>Escrow is NOT accepted for virtual cards, we accept escrow only for physical goods and physical cards.  The escrow cannot verify who spent the card and some user use it to scam us and then with another email order another card. To avoid this, escrow for virtual goods is not accepted. But we accept it for everything else.</li>
									<li>The card pass the 3-D Secure by Visa; MasterCard SecureCode with the PIN code included in the card.</li>
